To download the files,you have to get the animeout web pages that have the links and paste its source code in a .txt file and diffine in the config.py.To change other settings go to config.py there you can change and set quality,web_or_idm_defult_download_directrory,need_anime_websites_SourceCodes_junk_file.
I recomend using IDM downloader and if you are not set idm to False.

WARNINGS : Set the correct dirrectory of your downloader save directory or the program won't moniter the complition of the downloading files
           Use Ad Blocker or the last step on AnimeOut.xyz won't work.It will keep pressing on the ads or some thing else
           
Here is a example of setting the anime you need
